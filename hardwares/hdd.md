# HDD health
1. Check the hard diskâ€™s health at least once a week.  
The health of the hard disk refers to the percentage of the healthy sectors of the drive.  
The software I would recommend for measuring the health of your drive is `hard disk sentinel`.  
2. Take advantage of the sleep and hibernation modes.  
Hard disks are mechanical devices which means the more they run, the more they experience wear and tear internally. So whenever possible, always makes sure your pc is turned  off if it is not doing any work.  
3. Make sure your hard disk is defragmented regularly.  
4. Keep the hard disk in dry and cool environments.  
5. HDD should never be near sound buffers and noisy environments.
